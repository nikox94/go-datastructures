/*
* An implementation of a priority queue backed by a Fibonacci heap,
* as described by Fredman and Tarjan.  Fibonacci heaps are interesting
* theoretically because they have asymptotically good runtime guarantees
* for many operations.  In particular, insert, peek, and decrease-key all
* run in amortized O(1) time.  dequeueMin and delete each run in amortized
* O(lg n) time.  This allows algorithms that rely heavily on decrease-key
* to gain significant performance boosts.  For example, Dijkstra's algorithm
* for single-source shortest paths can be shown to run in O(m + n lg n) using
* a Fibonacci heap, compared to O(m lg n) using a standard binary or binomial
* heap.
*
* Internally, a Fibonacci heap is represented as a circular, doubly-linked
* list of trees obeying the min-heap property.  Each node stores pointers
* to its parent (if any) and some arbitrary child.  Additionally, every
* node stores its degree (the number of children it has) and whether it
* is a "marked" node.  Finally, each Fibonacci heap stores a pointer to
* the tree with the minimum value.
*
* To insert a node into a Fibonacci heap, a singleton tree is created and
* merged into the rest of the trees.  The merge operation works by simply
* splicing together the doubly-linked lists of the two trees, then updating
* the min pointer to be the smaller of the minima of the two heaps.  Peeking
* at the smallest element can therefore be accomplished by just looking at
* the min element.  All of these operations complete in O(1) time.
*
* The tricky operations are dequeueMin and decreaseKey.  dequeueMin works
* by removing the root of the tree containing the smallest element, then
* merging its children with the topmost roots.  Then, the roots are scanned
* and merged so that there is only one tree of each degree in the root list.
* This works by maintaining a dynamic array of trees, each initially null,
* pointing to the roots of trees of each dimension.  The list is then scanned
* and this array is populated.  Whenever a conflict is discovered, the
* appropriate trees are merged together until no more conflicts exist.  The
* resulting trees are then put into the root list.  A clever analysis using
* the potential method can be used to show that the amortized cost of this
* operation is O(lg n), see "Introduction to Algorithms, Second Edition" by
* Cormen, Rivest, Leiserson, and Stein for more details.
*
* The other hard operation is decreaseKey, which works as follows.  First, we
* update the key of the node to be the new value.  If this leaves the node
* smaller than its parent, we're done.  Otherwise, we cut the node from its
* parent, add it as a root, and then mark its parent.  If the parent was
* already marked, we cut that node as well, recursively mark its parent,
* and continue this process.  This can be shown to run in O(1) amortized time
* using yet another clever potential function.  Finally, given this function,
* we can implement delete by decreasing a key to -\infty, then calling
* dequeueMin to extract it.
